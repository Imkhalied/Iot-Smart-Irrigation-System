# Iot-Smart-Irrigation-System

## Project Overview
An IoT-based smart irrigation system designed to optimize water usage
by monitoring real-time environmental conditions using multiple sensors.
The system automates irrigation through closed-loop control logic
implemented on an ESP32 microcontroller.

## System Features
- Soil moisture–based irrigation control
- Rain detection override
- Water tank level monitoring using ultrasonic sensing
- Temperature and humidity monitoring
- Automated pump control via relay module
- Real-time serial monitoring

## Technologies Used
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Soil Moisture Sensor (SMR110)
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- YL-83 Rain Sensor
- Embedded C++ / Arduino IDE Framework
